## How It Works  

1. **Firebase Integration**:  
   - Movies are stored in a Firebase Realtime Database.  
   - Data is fetched, added, or updated in real-time using the Firebase SDK.  

2. **Routing**:  
   - React Router is used for navigation between different pages.  
   - Routes include:  
     - `/`: Displays the list of movies.  
     - `/add`: Opens the Add Movie form.  
     - `/about`: Displays the About page.  
     - `/movie/:id`: Displays details of a specific movie.  

3. **State Management**:  
   - Context API is used to manage the application state and share data across components.
